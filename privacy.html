Affiliated companies are entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with Quantic Worldwide, Inc.

            We collect information about you when you use our sites and applications. We receive and store this information when you enter it on our websites, send it to us, or provide it to us in any other way.
            
            We collect information when you choose to give it to us. This includes:
            
            contact information like name, email address, street address, and phone number;

            credit card number and billing information (for services requiring payment);
            your race, ethnicity, or gender, if you choose to provide it. Some employers are required by law to collect this information on a voluntary basis; or
            information about your business, such as company name, size, and business type.
            You can correct or remove this information by accessing your account settings. We also collect information from you in the following ways:
            
            Single Sign-on: If you choose to sign in to Quantic or Jobs.com with Facebook or similar services, we import the requested information from your account and we make it part of your profile.
            
            Referrals: We may collect from you personal information about others. For instance, if you choose to use our service to share site content with a friend, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We temporarily store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.
            
            Information automatically collected about you when you use Quantic
            We gather certain information automatically when you visit our sites or use our mobile applications. This information includes:

            your internet protocol (IP) address and internet service provider (ISP)

            the files viewed on our sites (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.)

            This data is collected about you automatically and is processed for Quantic’s legitimate interest. We combine this information with personal data to help detect and prevent fraud. We also combine this data with your profile and resume data to return the best job search results to you.
            
            Information collected about you from third parties
            If you are located in the United States, we may collect information about you from publicly-available websites. We may use this information to create a profile, even if you do not have an account with us, or append the information to an existing profile that you have with us. You will have the opportunity to claim collected information relating to you and to remove the information as described in this privacy policy. However we cannot guarantee that we will not later collect from publicly-available websites other information that pertains to you.
            
            How We Use Information

            to operate Quantic services;
            to contact and communicate with you when you contact us;
            to analyze, improve and optimize Quantic services; and
            to protect Quantic Services and the rights of users and others
            to enforce terms of Quantic’s services and prevent fraud and abuse of Quantic systems
            By registering with Quantic or Jobs.com, by managing your profile, by publicly posting information, or by opting in when presented with choices, you have consented for us to use your information in the following ways:
            
            To provide you with our services, which includes
            
            to create a Quantic account for you, including any resume you create or upload;
            to enable you to search for jobs and share them with others;
            to enable you to apply for jobs;
            if you are in the US, to add information gathered from public websites to your profile;
            to help potential employers find your resume and contact you;

            to inform you of other products or services available from Quantic or its affiliates;
            to conduct surveys, promotions and contests, and to publish the results thereof;

            to track which jobs you search for, view, and apply to;
            For security and fraud prevention
            
            to detect, investigate and prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal; and
            to make suggestions and draw inferences about you. For example, we may make suggestions about people you may know or additional jobs, products or services that might be of interest to you. Or, if you identify yourself as "Mrs." we will assume you are female.
            Some of our products and services, such as our resume and profile database and social media search, enable third parties to see your personal information and to contact you.
            
            Information you post in public areas of Quantic sites or applications or make visible in the resume and profile database may be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world, including those in countries that might not have legislation that guarantees adequate protection of personal information as defined by your country of residence. While Quantic takes measures to safeguard your information from unauthorized access or inappropriate use, Quantic does not control these third parties and we are not responsible for their use of information you give to us. Accordingly, you should not post sensitive information or any other information you would not want made public, to any Quantic site or application or to a public website.
            
            Our services include the display of personalized products, content, and advertising relating to your career experience and interests. We use data we have about you to determine whether you might be interested in the opportunities, products or services of a particular third party. We show you targeted ads online. These ads are targeted based on information we collect about you and information about you we acquire from third parties including public websites and data providers. Please see your account notification settings to customize the notification you receive and the About Our Ads page in our Privacy Center to learn more about targeted ads.
            
            How We Share Information
            We provide you with a platform to broadcast information about yourself to maximize your career opportunities. The information we gather may be shared with the following categories of third parties:
            
            the Quantic group of companies on a worldwide basis;
            employers, when you make your resume searchable or apply to a job;
            other companies hired to provide services on Quantic’s behalf;
            other third parties where required by law;
            other third parties when you give your consent to such sharing such as for resume writing services; or
            Alma Media, if you create an account on a Quantic website in Finland or Czech Republic.
            By applying to a job, providing your contact information to show interest in a job, or by replying to a message from an employer, you consent to the disclosure of your information to that employer and to be contacted by such employer for employment related purposes.
            
            We do not share contact information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. We also share information in the following ways
            
            1. We share your information with our service providers, which are third parties who help deliver our products and services to you. Examples of these services include hosting our web servers and site databases, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing customer management tools, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not use that data for any other purpose. We will remain responsible for any information shared in this way.
            
            2. We disclose information to third parties when you give your consent for us to do so. For example:
            
            (a) if you make your resume searchable or if we collect information you’ve made available on a public website then all parties with access to our resume or profile database products will have access to your information; or
            
            (b) if you opt in to receive information about the products or services of third parties, we supply your contact information to those third parties so they may contact you.
            
            We also share aggregated information (including location data) about visitors to Quantic sites and application users with third parties to serve advertisements to you online. We also aggregate data regarding job qualifications, schooling, age, experience level or other information relevant to the job search. This aggregated data does not identify users individually, and may be made available to employers or shared publicly. If we create a co-branded site with another company, information collected on that site will be retained by both companies and subject to the privacy policies of both companies which will be published on the co-branded sites.
            
            3. We may disclose to third parties information that we have collected from other websites.
            
            4. We disclose information if legally required to do so, or at our discretion pursuant to a request from a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith - after considering your privacy interests and other factors - that such action is necessary to: (a) meet legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) investigate fraud, prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.
            
            5. We may disclose and transfer personal information to a third party who acquires any or all of Quantic’s business units, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event Quantic becomes the subject of an insolvency proceeding, such information will be disposed of in a transaction approved by the court. You will be notified of the sale of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third party by email or through a prominent notice posted on the site.
